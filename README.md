## Overview

This project aims to predict the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) using data scraped from various sources. We utilize web scraping techniques with Selenium, BeautifulSoup4, and data analysis tools like Pandas. Two machine learning models, Ridge Regression and Random Forest, implemented using scikit-learn, were employed for prediction.
