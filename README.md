## Overview

This project aims to predict the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) using data scraped from various sources. We utilize web scraping techniques with Selenium, BeautifulSoup4, and data analysis tools like Pandas. Two machine learning models, Ridge Regression and Random Forest, implemented using scikit-learn, were employed for prediction.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Python scripts for web scraping, data processing, and model implementation.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models for future use.

## Tech Stack

- **Web Scraping:**
  - Selenium: Automation tool for web scraping.
  - BeautifulSoup4: Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

- **Data Analysis:**
  - Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.

- **Machine Learning:**
  - scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building and training models.
